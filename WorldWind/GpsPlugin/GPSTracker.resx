    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

To get started please read the following Help text:

Add new GPS sources by right clicking on the type of source to add (COM, TCP, UDP, etc) in the Sources Tree View and selecting add from the context menu.
When a new source is added its icon is a red square, this means that this source has not been configured yet.
To configure a source just select it by clicking on it and entering the appropriate values in the Tabbed Panel at the right of the Sources Tree view.
You will see a Help Tab for each source with instructions on how to setup the selected source.
Once a Source has been configured, by clicking on the 'Apply' button, its icon will change to the default red circle with a number inside.
Right clicking on a Source will bring up a context menu that will let you change the Icon of the selected source, rename it, set it as the main source for World Wind to track (World Wind will follow this source) and delete it.
Source Icons are displayed at their original size. The icon size will remain constant at any zoom level.

Use the General Tab to select some general settings:
Select 'Track Heading' if you want the World View heading to 'follow' the heading from the GPS data.
Select '2D Map' (default is not selected) to set the Vertical exaggeration to 0 when GPS Tracker is running, displaying the map in 2D. 
If '2D Map' is not selected then the selected V. Exaggeration will remain effective while GPS Tracker is running.
Select 'Information Text' to cause the Information text to be shown in all icons.
Select 'Track Line' to show the track of the selected GPS icon
Select 'Record Session' to save into a file the activity of all your GPS devices and POI. If this is selected, when you click 'Track', GPSTracker will save a copy of the activity of all your GPS and POI icons. When you disable GPSTracker a window will pop up asking for the filename you want to select for this session.
Session files can be played back by selecting them in the 'Files' tab, just as any other file. If a Session file is selected no other device or POI for the list will be shown.
While a session is being recorded you can add POI but they will not be saved.
While a session is being played back you can add POI, but they will not be saved.
In 'NMEA Export Path' select the path where an NMEA GPGGA text version of the data from the selected source will be saved. See the Help in the specific source for more info.
For GpsTracker to send emails when GeoFence events ocurres it is necessary to fill the email information:
In the 'Outgoing SMTP server' text box enter your SMTP server address for sending emails. You should be able to see this information on your email client settings.
In the 'From Email Address' anter the email address to use for sending the email. Again see you email client for this information.

Once all your selections have been made, click on the 'Track' button to start processing all the selected and configured sources.
On the bottom-right corner you should see the message 'GPSTracker: Fix' if there's at least one GPS fix or 'GPSTracker: No Fix' if there's no GPS fix at all. The message can be turn on and off from the 'GPSTracker\Fix Status' entry under the Layer Manager.

If there is a GPS fix, you should see the selected icon for every GPS source along with information text.
Clicking on an icon makes GPSTracker 'follow' that device.
Holding 'Left Control' while clicking on an icon turns the info message on and off.
If the information text is off it will be visible by rolling the mouse over the icon.
Holding 'Right Control' while clicking on an icon will toggle the 'Track Heading' function on and off.
Clicking a GPS Icon while pressing 'Left Alt' will toggle showing the track line for that Icon on and off.

To set a Point Of Interest hold 'Left Shift' and click anywhere in the world.
Holding 'Right Alt' and clicking on a GPS icon will cause all POI icons to display the distance between the POI and the selected GPS icon.
Holding 'Right Alt' and clicking on a POI icon will cause all GPS icons to display the distance between the POI and the GPS icon and the bearing from the GPS icon to the selected POI.

All or some of the icons and information text can be turn on and off from the 'GPSTracker' entry under the Layer Manager.

If the GPSTracker Toolbar icon appears selected, it means that GPSTracker is running.
Click on the GPSTracker Toolbar icon to Disable GPSTracker.

Select the Update Tab to check for updates and to go to the Update page. Click on 'Check for Updates' to check if an update is available. Version information will be displayed.
Click on 'Go to Update Page' to go to the download page.

Thank you for using GPSTracker for WorldWind.</value>

    <value>GeoFences are areas on the map that are monitored for Gps sources going in or out of them.
Actions can be triggered when a source goes in and/or out of a selected GeoFence.

GeoFences can be created in 2 ways:

1. Enter the Latitude and Longitude of all the vertices of the GeoFence in the Geo Fence Vertices Tab by double clicking on an entry.
An empty entry signal the end of the vertices list.

2. Draw the area directly on the map by clicking on the map while holding the Left Alt key.
The Area gets closed when clicking back on the first vertice.
When closed a window will pop up asking setup information for the area. This information is the same one as the data in the Actions Tab.
NOTE: For better accuracy while drawing the GeoFence, the map should be in 2D mode (Vertical Exaggeration = 0).

Once an area is defined. The Actions tab is used for selecting what actions to perform when a source enters or leaves the area.
Available actions are:
. Sending an email. You must enter the email address and fill the email information in the General Tab.
. Play a sound. Different sound files can be selected for entering and leaving a zone.
. Show a window. The window will have information about the source: location, name, date and time.
